// Package display provides the ability to represent and manipulate a logical dot matrix display.
// A dot-matrix display is modelled as a two-dimensional array of bits in which 1 represents a filled pixel and
// 0 represents an unfilled pixel.  Drawing surfaces are represented by the Canvas type and can be observed
// so that changes are pushed to the physical display.
