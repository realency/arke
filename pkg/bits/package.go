// Package bits provides the means to store and manipulate two-dimensional arrays of bits.
// 2D bit arrays can be provisioned in Go using [][]bool, however this package provides
// more efficient storage and manipulation as well as convenient read/write mechanisms.
// Types and functions defined in the bits package are fundamental to the modelling and
// manipulation of dot-matrix displays.
